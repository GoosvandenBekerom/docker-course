 *
 *  1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.
 *
 *      Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
 *
 * 	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 * 	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 * 	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
 *
 *  2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 *  share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
 *  creator(s) a pint.
 *
 *  3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
 *  you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
