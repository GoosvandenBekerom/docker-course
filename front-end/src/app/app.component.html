  ~
  ~  1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.
  ~
  ~      Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
  ~
  ~ 	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
  ~ 	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
  ~ 	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
  ~
  ~  2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
  ~  share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
  ~  creator(s) a pint.
  ~
  ~  3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
  ~  you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
